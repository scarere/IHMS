''' 
Here are the gdx functions used in a typical program to collect data:
gdx.open_usb() or gdx.open_ble()
gdx.select_sensors()
gdx.start()
gdx.read()
gdx.stop()
gdx.close()
Here are other functions that might be useful for customizing a program:
gdx.device_info()
gdx.enabled_sensor_info()
gdx.sensor_info()
gdx.discover_ble_devices()
monitor_rssi()
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Below is a simple starter program. Note that this program does not pass any 
arguments in the functions. Go to the gdx_getting_started_2.py example to 
see how you can pass arguments to the open(), select sensors(), and start() 
functions, and avoid the prompts.
**** This example assumes the Go Direct sensor is connected via USB.
